# Welcome to Skins!!
A fake product landing page.
It is a fake landing page made for the only purpose of acquiring skills. It is for the Landing page project of the Freecodecamp available here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page.
I do not own or intend to own any of the various assets (images and videos) that have been used for this project.
Inspiration:
- design by https://dribbble.com/shots/15013327-Web-Header
- images and product by https://www.allbeauty.com/1242348-lanza-wellness-cbd-soothing-serum-30ml
- video from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0FnlTgLKjo&ab_channel=L%27ANZA
